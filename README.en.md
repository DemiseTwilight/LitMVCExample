# LitMVC Example Project
LitMVC Project URL: https://github.com/DemiseTwilight/LitMVC.git  
A lightweight MVC framework for Unity <br> 
Suitable for quickly developing basic UI system structures for small to medium-sized projects.  
This branch is for the generation path solution. For the binding solution, please switch to the `bindingSolution` branch.

## Usage
Place the LitMVC directory directly into your project. This project only implements the MVC part, and the rest are example codes. If you want to use it in your project, please:
<li>Build the data model loading part yourself and create scripts in the Model directory to hold it.</li>
<li>Build the management and control part of the UIManager yourself to make it better fit your project.</li>

## Structure
![MVC Framework.png](MVC框架.png)
#### Interface
A Unity prefab that can be placed anywhere. Child nodes with `_` in their names can be recognized by the tool, which will automatically generate code and bind them.
#### View
The interface binding script generated by the tool. After generation, it is automatically bound to the prefab. Each time the tool is invoked, it regenerates the script. Inherits from the `UIView` script.
#### Logic
The interface logic script generated by the tool. It is generated only once and not refreshed. Write logic code here. Inherits from `UIView` and can use features provided by `MonoBehaviour`.  
It calls the Service layer through dependencies and receives events. Logic scripts should avoid coupling with each other and use the event system or Service as a mediator for communication.
#### Service
Business logic scripts. It is recommended to use the singleton pattern and respond to Logic via events to reduce coupling. If multiple implementations are needed, consider adding an interface layer for decoupling.  
This script holds data and can depend on other Service scripts.
#### Model
The data layer. It is recommended to use the singleton pattern to hold and load data. Data models can be placed anywhere, and you need to write the loading logic yourself.

## Tools
Click the `CreateUIView` option on the prefab to automatically generate View and Logic scripts.<br>
If there are issues with the path, try clicking the "Auto Fill" button in the Config file.
